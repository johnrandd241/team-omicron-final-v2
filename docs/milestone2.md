## API
For our project, our API gets displays to the user, such as events, login, register, and once requested by the user, it displays a new page. This new page for log in and register asks the user for information, and once gathered and the user hits submit, it redirects to a profile page.

### Division of labor

Connor A. worked on the header and navigation bar, John S. focused on the page content for events and profile, and John R. deployed server and wrote code to switch between the pages on server.js
